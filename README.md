## Project Summary

* In this project we chose to analyze food comsumption and security catigorized by food groups in mutiple countries around the world. We believe that proper nutrition is very important but the truth is that it is easy to have bad eating habits without ever realizing so hopefully this website can shed light on some unhealthy eating habits.
* We used Mongo, Javascript, HTML and python in order to create a website that projects all our findings in a way that can be viewed and used by people curious about the subject.

## Research Questions

1. Which Countries consume the most of each food group?
2. What was the most consumed food group throughout the world?
3. Which Country has the most balanced diet?
4. What is the Impact of Covid on food insecurity?
5. Is there a difference in food consumption based on different demographics? (Ex: children,Adults, household income level)
6. What can we conclude through the findings?

## Website Pages Explanation
#### Home
  * landing page
#### Graphs
  * Visualizations
#### Menu
  * Placeholder for future nutritional recipes
  * One of the reasons we chose to take a closer look at personal food consumption in this project is because it can be easy to over-eat and it can be hard to know what the proper intake levels should be for a single meal. Also, when making food at home it can be hard to measure your food intake. To combat this issue we created a menu page as a place to showcase nutritional recipes people can make at home or help people gain a better understanding of what a proper balanced meal consists of. 
#### News
  * Shows the food insecurity rates (total & child) due to covid-19 for multiple years. This page shows a map view of every county for all states in the Unted States.
#### Map
  * Showcases food consumption in multiple countries

## Reports
At the end of the project some conclusions we found was...
1. The Most consumed food group was protein followed by grains, then vegetables, and fruit
2. The least consumed food group was discretionary fats, oils, and added sugars followed by fruits
3. People eat most of their meals at home followed by fast food and we found that people eat more at fast food establishments than actual restaurants.
4. Food insecurity rates are higher now compared to 2019 but even in 2019, child food insecurity rates were worse than total food insecurity rates. (for NJ)
